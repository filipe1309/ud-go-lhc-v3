### Raw string literals

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	fmt.Println("Hello Gophers! ❤️💕😊👍😁(❁´◡`❁)£¥©🙌👌🎶😎🐼🦄🦁🐶😺🤓")

	// raw string literal
	fmt.Println(`
	UTF-8 saves space. 
	In UTF-8, common characters like “C” take 8 bits, 
	while rare characters like “💕” take 32 bits. 
	Other characters take 16 or 24 bits. 
	A blog post like this one takes about 
	four times less space in UTF-8 
	than it would in UTF-32. 
	So it loads four times faster.
	`)
